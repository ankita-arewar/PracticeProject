	<h1>General Notice</h1>
	<h6>Notice can be described as a written or a printed information or news announcement. It is written in for basically informing people or pupils (in a school) about an activity or an event and is specifically only meant for a select group. Since a notice is a formal announcement or piece of information, its tone and style are formal and it is strictly factual. Its language is also simple and formal. It’s is important to note that a notice is always, and doesn’t include flowery language.</h6>

	<p>The occasions for creating a notice could be a competition, an inauguration to take place in near future or an exhibition. It could also be school activities like an excursion, a meeting or show.</p>

	<p>In this article, we will give emphasis on the CBSE pattern, and help students learn important points about notice writing.</p>
